Flash 'Em! Application
CPSC 1302 Final Project
Created by: Jonathan Co, Vincent Miller, Michael Soskin, Ryan Zimmerman

Overview:
Our application is designed to offer a digital solution to using flashcards. The user may have an array of flashcards created from a .csv (comma-separated values) file that they have organized via the format: question, answer. Additionally, Flash â€˜Em! allows the student to create, remove, or edit a given flashcard from the GUI for quick maintenance. For a more dynamic experience, the cards can be shuffled and sorted to promote a more challenging study session and avoid learning by static flashcard patterns.

How-To:
FlashEm.java is our driver/main program that runs the application.
FlashEm_GUI.java, FileInOut.java, Module3.java, and UserEdit.java are the support files.

flashcards.csv is the import file for flashcard objects.
It comes preloaded with 6 example/test flashcards.

flashcards2.csv only exists upon export/writing to CSV file. It write to a separate file to preserve the first file in case of errors. You must rename flashcards2.csv to flashcards.csv if you wish to import the updated flashcards.
